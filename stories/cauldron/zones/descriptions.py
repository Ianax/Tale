    {'foyer': "The foyer has a warm, dusty feel. Dark wood floors support antique furniture. Black \
laced curtains frame misty windows that prevent a clear view outisde. A dim light comes from the chandelier above, \
and a pair of candles burn on a console table.",

     'sitting_room': "This cozy sitting room is warmed by a fire in the fireplace. A long couch and a pair of \
overstuffed chairs leave a perfect place to sit and get warm. A bookshelf sits in the corner, laden with leather \
bound books that appear very old.",

     'dining_room': "This large dining room is set with several tables of various sizes. Fine crystal glasses and \
silver utensils adorn the tables, and a large fire burns brightly in the fireplace.",

sarah_text = {'description': "Sarah sits here, stretched out in a high backed chair, a book with a black cover in her right hand. A black dress, long black hair, ebony skin and dark eyes, only a blue amulet on a silver chain about her neck provides any color. She stares at you with a gentle but bemused expression.",

'about_herself': "Sarah stares at you for a painfully long moment, without moving, before she shifts and nods.'Right. About me. Well you could say I'm the owner of this little establishment. Or its prisoner. But I prefer governess. I make sure things operate according to plan. At least, some plan.'",
