    {'foyer': "The foyer has a warm, dusty feel. Dark wood floors support antique furniture. Black \
laced curtains frame misty windows that prevent a clear view outisde. A dim light comes from the chandelier above, \
and a pair of candles burn on a console table.",

     'sitting_room': "This cozy sitting room is warmed by a fire in the fireplace. A long couch and a pair of \
overstuffed chairs leave a perfect place to sit and get warm. A bookshelf sits in the corner, laden with leather \
bound books that appear very old.",

     'dining_room': "This large dining room is set with several tables of various sizes. Fine crystal glasses and \
silver utensils adorn the tables, and a large fire burns brightly in the fireplace.",
