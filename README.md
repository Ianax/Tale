Tale requires Python 3.5 or newer.
(If you have an older version of Python, stick to Tale 2.8 or older, which still supports Python 2.7 as well)

Required third party libraries:
- ``appdirs`` (to load and save games and config data in the correct folder).
- ``colorama`` (for stylized console output)
- ``serpent`` (to be able to create save game data from the game world)
- ``smartypants`` (for nicely quoted string output)
 
Optional third party library:
- ``prompt_toolkit``  (provides a nicer console text interface experience)

Read the documentation for more details on how to get started. It is online at http://pythonhosted.org/tale/
