Concepts for single player IF (and possibly MUD):
-------------------------------------------------
Quests / Tasks / To-do list.



Concepts that could be implemented for a MUD (but not really for single player IF):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mailbox system: can mail messages, money and items to other players. Only when mailbox in environment?
Bulletin boards.
Language system: speak/understand different languages
Pets: tame/befriend/abandon (charisma/luck)
Combat: backstab (stealth/charisma/luck/agility?  vs luck/wisdom/agility)
Follow other creatures: follow.  If you have a follower and want to try to stop him: evade
Party: team up with other players and share quest and combat experience
Skills: stealth, lockpicking, ...
Vendors and shops: stock, sell stuff, buy stuff, haggle?

Wiretaps: as soon as invisible objects and room message notifications are implemented, replace the
    wiretap attribute on Location by a real wiretap object that's placed in the room. It relays the
    messages it receives to the owner.  (needs to auto-destruct if the owner is gone)
    Wiretaps on livings are a bit harder to replace by a normal object because they need
    to intercept the stuff thats told to the living, and there's no regular game mechanic to do that.
