Vendors and shops: stock, sell stuff, buy stuff, haggle?

Wiretaps: as soon as invisible objects and room message notifications are implemented, replace the
    wiretap attribute on Location by a real wiretap object that's placed in the room. It relays the
    messages it receives to the owner.  (needs to auto-destruct if the owner is gone)
    Wiretaps on livings are a bit harder to replace by a normal object because they need
    to intercept the stuff thats told to the living, and there's no regular game mechanic to do that.
