Concepts for single player Interactive Fiction mode:
Interesting link: http://www.brasslantern.org/writers/
------------------------------------------------------
[BUG,tkinter] demo story: when you reach the exit, the GUI isn't shut down
[cosmetic,tkinter] implement text styling (instead of stripping it all out)
[cosmetic,tkinter] show non-formatted paragraphs in monospaced font
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional picture to every MudObject description. (with fabulous.image even displayable on linux/osx xterm)
[feature] standalone HTTP server mode with HTML+Javascript frontend.

Concepts for multiplayer MUD mode (and not really for single player I.F.):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BUG] custom verbs are registered on the location.verbs list. This won't work in multi-user mode.
[BUG] driver.player and driver.async_player_input are globals and this won't work in multi-user mode.
[feature] Pyro interface with standalone remote client (console or GUI).
[feature] Telnet interface.
[feature] Let driver store player's state once in a while (every minute or so), when they logout, and when they get disconnected.
[feature] New mud-mode save command that immediately triggers the driver to store the player's state.
[feature] Let players define aliases for certain commands (including args) "alias w_s=wield sword"
[feature] Write stuff to a logfile for the server admins.
[feature] Mailbox system: can mail messages, money and items to other players. Only when mailbox in vicinity (unless wizard)
[feature] Notify player if mail arrived.
[feature] Simple Bulletin boards. Readonly (except by wizards) and read/write for everyone.
[feature] Pets: tame/befriend/abandon (charisma/luck)
[feature] Combat: backstab (stealth/charisma/luck/agility?  vs luck/wisdom/agility)
[feature] Follow other creatures: follow.  If you have a follower and want to try to stop him: evade
[feature] Party: team up with other players and share quest and combat experience
[feature] Skills: stealth, lockpicking, ...
[feature] Vendors and shops: stock, sell stuff, buy stuff, haggle?
[feature] World zones: (optional) timed zone resets to reset to starting configuration. Or global server reset?

[info,feature] Do something with the circlemud xml data:
    http://www.razorvine.net/download/circlemuddata_converters.zip
    original from: http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/03/19/circlemud-data-in-xml-format-for-your-text-adventure-game/

[info,feature] DAMAGE TYPES:
    blunt, slash, pierce, water, shock, cold, heat, gas, acid, magic, poison, disease, sonic, psionic,
    trauma/wound, suffocation, deathray, EMP, karma, pressure, decompression, inertia


General ideas/TODO:
-------------------
[BUG] many actions are aborted with ActionRefused exception. This doesn't update the previously_parsed data. (open door -> it's locked. examine it -> you mean key?)
[BUG] Parser: <say "I don't get it"> -> it thinks the message stops at the single quote in "don't". => "the verb sayt is unrecognised"
[BUG] on python3.3, blinker signals aren't removed properly (!wiretap -clear doesn't work)
[BUG] when using readline, pypy crashes due to input being done from different threads (https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1349)
    (code contains a workaround for the time being: readline not enabled on pypy)

[code,API] Allow story to override/remove soul verbs, remove_verbs_except([v1,v2,v3,...]), add_verbs([...])
[code,API] Create a TwoWayExit/TwoWayDoor that connects 2 locations to each other in one go? (by creating 2 Exits/Doors internally?)
    (in the case of Door: how to link both doors to the same state?)

[publish] sdist -> upload the demo story as a separate file? (can sdist create multiple files?)
[code,refactor,API] Player.input/io.input is an immediate-input method that blocks. Rewrite it to use io.input_line?
[code,cosmetic,API] Use a decorator to add custom verbs to items, rather than handle_verb + item.verbs=....
[code] Make sure all console input() is always done from the same thread? (fixes pypy crash)
[cosmetic] Support text style tags in the messages files on disk too. (banner, motd, welcome).
[cosmetic,gui] Font selection dialog for Io adapters that support it (tkinter, html)
[cosmetic,gui] Add a box / area to the GUI where additional status messages can be displayed (game score? turns? time? etc.. + api call for story), and/or menu buttons.
[cosmetic] Allow story config to override the style colors mapping so they can define their own rendering of <item> for instance
[cosmetic] Extra text style tags?
    <center> text style which centers the line(s) on the screen. (paragraph-level? just like 'formatted'?)
    <line>   add a horizontal line break.
    <unf>    force a new unformatted paragraph (i.e. use monospace font, don't wrap/justify text)
    <clear>  clears the screen (needs fix for http://code.google.com/p/colorama/issues/detail?id=35)
[code,API] Self-modifying rooms/exits to create a more dynamic game world.
    Do this with state transitions through conditional exits? Or actually replace exits/locations with new ones?
[code,refactor,API] Exits should be defined more clearly, instead of scattered through the code on a per-room basis.
[code] Should there be a single table where all exits are defined? But how to link to the exit's class if it is not a base exit?
[code] Finite-state-machine to support multi-phase actions (such as a short dialog with an npc)?
    (note: less suited for MUDs because other people might interfere with the states)
[code,cosmetic] input should be case insensitive (everything except stuff in quotes - the message)
    commands, adverbs, names - all should be lowercased and compared by lowercase.
[feature] Load story from a zipfile. VFS should thus be able to load resources from a zipfile too. (don't use setuptools pkg_resources for that)
[feature] Parser: allow simple question/answer dialog. 'no/yes' verbs? Use answer/say/tell? (Sate Machine = overkill for a simple question state)?
[code] prototypes to extend items/npc instead of inheritance?
[code] Use a DSL to define the basic world stuff? (including ASCII-art parser to easily define mazes/dungeons)
[test] what happens when player name == npc name (movement, examine, talk, soul emotes, destroy player)
[test] what happens with multiple items of same name in room, in inventory, in bag
[feature] Change living location logic so that livings can sit inside a container item too.
    Then:  go-in (wizard): step into something, go-out (wizard): step out of current location
    + take <living> can actually work! (take ant, trap rabbit in cage, ...)


[feature] Light/Dark
--------------------
light level in rooms: dark/light? or three states?  (0=pitch black, 0.5=dark/dusk, 1=normal daylight)
darkness in locations -> can't see location/exits/items/players (unless they're fluorescent, or unless you explicitly examine <direction>?)
if there's a lightsource in the room (or someone has a light source in their inventory), the room is lit.
 Conditional location description (light/dark etc)
