Concepts for single player Interactive Fiction mode:
Interesting link: http://www.brasslantern.org/writers/
------------------------------------------------------
[cosmetic,tkinter] show non-formatted paragraphs in monospaced font
[BUG] tkinter doesn't stop anymore when app is exited (caused by critical error handler???)   (alt-f4)
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional picture to every MudObject description. (with fabulous.image even displayable on linux/osx xterm)
[feature] Add optional sound clip to locations
[feature] standalone HTTP server mode with HTML+Javascript frontend.

Concepts for multiplayer MUD mode (and not really for single player I.F.):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BUG] custom verbs are registered on the location.verbs list. This won't work in multi-user mode.
[BUG] driver.player and driver.async_player_input are globals and this won't work in multi-user mode.
[feature] Pyro interface with standalone remote client (console or GUI).
[feature] Telnet interface.
[feature] Let driver store player's state once in a while (every minute or so), when they logout, and when they get disconnected.
[feature] New mud-mode save command that immediately triggers the driver to store the player's state.
[feature] Let players define aliases for certain commands (including args) "alias w_s=wield sword"
[feature] Write stuff to a logfile for the server admins.
[feature] Mailbox system: can mail messages, money and items to other players. Only when mailbox in vicinity (unless wizard)
[feature] Notify player if mail arrived.
[feature] Simple Bulletin boards. Readonly (except by wizards) and read/write for everyone.
[feature] Pets: tame/befriend/abandon (charisma/luck)
[feature] Combat: backstab (stealth/charisma/luck/agility?  vs luck/wisdom/agility)
[feature] Follow other creatures: follow.  If you have a follower and want to try to stop him: evade
[feature] Party: team up with other players and share quest and combat experience
[feature] Skills: stealth, lockpicking, ...
[feature] Vendors and shops: stock, sell stuff, buy stuff, haggle?
[feature] World zones: (optional) timed zone resets to reset to starting configuration. Or global server reset?

[info,feature] Do something with the circlemud xml data:
    http://www.razorvine.net/download/circlemuddata_converters.zip
    data files from: http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/03/19/circlemud-data-in-xml-format-for-your-text-adventure-game/

[info,feature] DAMAGE TYPES:
    blunt, slash, pierce, water, shock, cold, heat, gas, acid, magic, poison, disease, sonic, psionic,
    trauma/wound, suffocation, deathray, EMP, karma, pressure, decompression, inertia


General ideas/TODO:
-------------------
[BUG] Parser: <say "I don't get it"> -> it thinks the message stops at the single quote in "don't". => "the verb sayt is unrecognised"
[BUG] on python3.3, blinker signals aren't removed properly (!wiretap -clear doesn't work)
[BUG] when using readline, pypy crashes due to input being done from different threads (https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1349)
    (code contains a workaround for the time being: readline not enabled on pypy)

[code] To allow for more complex objects and descriptions, add a 'part' object that belongs to its owner object. (only Items?)
    They're not mentioned in a general 'look' but can be accessed if referenced directly by name.
    Other objects/livings descriptions may ofcourse mention them as clues.
    This allows for a car with an engine and doors, where only the car is mentioned in a 'look'.
    It is lightweight (no logic, only descriptions). Moving the owning object moves all its parts along with it.
    This requires adding code to all places an item is searched.... (it needs to search the parts too now)
    Interaction with the part is done by owner object's handle_part_verb?
[feature] conditional/changing exits, for instance a hatch that is not there until you 'discover' it.
[cosmetic] Support text style tags in the messages files on disk too. (banner, motd, welcome).
[publish] upload the story(s) as separate files to pypi? http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/extending.html#adding-new-distribution-types
[code,refactor,API] Player.input/io.input is an immediate-input method that blocks. Rewrite it to use io.input_line?
[code,cosmetic,API] Use a decorator to add custom verbs to items, rather than handle_verb + item.verbs=....
[code] Make sure all console input() is always done from the same thread? (fixes pypy crash)
[cosmetic,gui] Font selection dialog for Io adapters that support it (tkinter, html)
[cosmetic,gui] Add a box / area to the GUI where additional status messages can be displayed (game score? turns? time? etc.. + api call for story), and/or menu buttons.
[cosmetic] Extra text style tags?
    <center> text style which centers the line(s) on the screen. (paragraph-level? just like 'formatted'?)
    <line>   add a horizontal line break.
    <unf>    force a new unformatted paragraph (i.e. use monospace font, don't wrap/justify text)
    <clear>  clears the screen (needs fix for http://code.google.com/p/colorama/issues/detail?id=35)
[code] Finite-state-machine to support multi-phase actions (such as a short dialog with an npc)?
    (note: less suited for MUDs because other people might interfere with the states)
[code,cosmetic] input should be case insensitive (everything except stuff in quotes - the message)
    commands, adverbs, names - all should be lowercased and compared by lowercase.
[feature] Load story from a zipfile. VFS should thus be able to load resources from a zipfile too: use module.__loader__.get_data(...)
[feature] Parser: allow simple question/answer dialog. 'no/yes' verbs? Use answer/say/tell?
    Sate Machine = overkill for a simple question state?
    But it needs to work eventually in a multi user system...
[code] prototypes to extend items/npc instead of inheritance?
[code] Use a DSL to define the basic world stuff, and convert it to python source
[test] double names.
    What happens when player name == npc name (movement, examine, talk, soul emotes, destroy player)
    What happens with multiple items of same name in room, in inventory, in bag
    make a little menu that gives an enumerated choice of the stuff with the same name?

[feature] Change living location logic so that livings can sit inside a container item too.
    Then:  go-in (wizard): step into something, go-out (wizard): step out of current location
    + take <living> can actually work! (take ant, trap rabbit in cage, ...)


[feature] Light/Dark
--------------------
light level in rooms: dark/light? or three states?  (0=pitch black, 0.5=dark/dusk, 1=normal daylight)
darkness in locations -> can't see location/exits/items/players (unless they're fluorescent, or unless you explicitly examine <direction>?)
if there's a lightsource in the room (or someone has a light source in their inventory), the room is lit.
 Conditional location description (light/dark etc)
