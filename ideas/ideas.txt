Concepts for single player Interactive Fiction mode:

------------------------------------------------------
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional picture to every MudObject description.
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional sound clip to locations
[html]  use websockets or comet long polling instead of 0.5 sec ajax polling to update the text in the browser

Concepts for multiplayer MUD mode (and not really for single player I.F.):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[feature] implement IP-address based ban
[circle] fix the zone errors (putting items into non-existing containers)
[code] the story_data from a player object should be stored into the account database when account is saved and restored when account is loaded.
    this allows for the story to add stuff to account creation and add extra persistent fields to a player.
[feature] Write things (including crash logs) to a logfile for the server admins.
[feature] check all commands if they provide appropriate feedback to others in the room (such as "Xyz looks around")
[feature] SSH interface via Paramiko?
[feature] Let driver store player's state once in a while (every minute or so), when they logout, and when they get disconnected.
[feature] New mud-mode save command that immediately triggers the driver to store the player's state. (already exists for IF-mode)
[feature] Mailbox system: can mail messages, money and items to other players. Only when mailbox in vicinity (unless wizard). Notify player if mail arrived.
[feature] Follow other creatures: follow.  If you have a follower and want to try to stop him: evade/flee
[feature] World zones: (optional) timed zone resets to reset to starting configuration. Or global server reset? (circle has zones and zone resets)
[feature] DAMAGE TYPES:
    blunt, slash, pierce, water, shock, cold, heat, gas, acid, magic, poison, disease, sonic, psionic,
    trauma/wound, suffocation, deathray (zap-command), EMP, karma, pressure, decompression, inertia


General ideas/TODO:
-------------------
[code] make money an object as well that you can drop/pick up. See circlemud? handler.c/create_money and obj vnum #5015
[code] a story must be able to add extra dialog to the create-new-player process.
[code] Make a wizard kill command that instantly kills a living and/or player. Nothing remains. (see ACMD(do_kill) in act.offensive.c)
    This requires a combat system with healt/damage/death logic in place though (what happens to dead creatures? corpse/loot drop/respawn?)
[code] If door is opened/unlocked/lockpicked, tell this to the room AND also the room on the other side
[code] (once locations have flags such as 'outside') make out/outside a meta-exit that looks for obvious exit to take to to to outside location.
[code] Flesh out more items/templates in items.basic.  Take ideas from objects in other mudlibs
[feature] conditional/changing/invisible exits, for instance a hatch that is not there until you 'discover' it. (circle data contains such exits?)
[feature] allow livings to wear items/armour on various body parts, extend circle zone loader to use this
[feature] allow livings to wield a single item (weapon/light/shield/...) (=always in hand), extend circle zone loader to use this
[code, API] path-finding: GOTO/GO TO <location/living/item> (must have examined it before, to remember it. See also next idea).
[code, API] search/find/locate: keep track of stuff you've encountered and mention that if the player searches for something
    (like: search key -> "you remember that there was [a key] [somewhere at/in/on <location>]")
[publish] upload the story(s) as separate files to pypi? http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/extending.html#adding-new-distribution-types
[feature] show a list of duplicates if dealing with multiple things with the same name?
[code] Define a DSL to define the basic world stuff, and convert it to python source (or parse directly). Much like the circle importers.
[feature] Hunger/thirst/fatigue?


[feature] Light/Dark
--------------------
light level in rooms: dark/light? or three states?  (0=pitch black, 0.5=dark/dusk, 1=normal daylight)
darkness in locations -> can't see location/exits/items/players (unless they're fluorescent, or unless you explicitly examine <direction>?)
if there's a lightsource in the room (or someone has a light source in their inventory), the room is lit. (thus: determine light state dynamically)
Dynamic Day/night cycle?  Note that some rooms should always be lit (inside a building perhaps) so a flag for that is needed.
