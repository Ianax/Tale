Quickstart:
Run the included test world by starting the driver:

$ python -m tale.driver

Choose not to load a saved game (you will have none at first start anyway).
Choose to create a default player character or build a custom one.
Type 'help' and 'help soul' to get an idea of the stuff you can type in.



Tale is 100% pure Python and runs on Python 2.7 and 3.2+.
It should also work on Pypy and Ironpython, but no guarantees.
