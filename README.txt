Read the documentation for more details on how to get started.
Tale is 100% pure Python and runs on Python 2.7 and 3.2+.
It should also work on Pypy and Ironpython, but no guarantees.

There are a few bugs in Jython 2.7 still that prevent it to run Tale,
read the documentation for more information about this. If Jython 2.7 gets
these bugs fixed in a new release, it should be able to run Tale as well.
